# while loop notes

# IN ENGLISH:
# if condition is True:
#   run some block of code
#   if false, block is skipped
# else:
#   this block runs if no other conditions are met

   
# How to use a counter
#   Keeps track of number of times loop is executed.


# Common mistake: 



# Countdown Challenge (on own)
#   Make a counter that counts down from 10 and then says "BLAST OFF!"




# Count by 5's Challenge(on own)
#   Count 0-100 by 5's
#   Print a message to tell the user when the count is half-way done
