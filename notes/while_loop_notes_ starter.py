# IN ENGLISH:
# if condition is True:
#   run some block of code
#   if false, block is skipped
# else:
#   this block runs if no other conditions are met

#   Make a counter that counts down from 10 and then says "BLAST OFF!"


input("\nPress enter to exit.")

# Count by 5's Challenge(on own)
#   Count 0-100 by 5's
#   Print a message to tell the user when the count is half-way done


input("\nPress enter to exit.")
