# Complete the following code to test whether two circles, each
#     having a user-defined radius and a fixed center point lying
#     along the same horizontal line, are disjoint, overlapping, or
#     mutually contained.

x1 = float(input("Enter the position on the x-axis of the first circle: "))
radius1 = float(input("Enter the radius of the first circle: "))

x2 = float(input("Enter the position on the x-axis of the second circle: "))
radius2 = float(input("Enter the radius of the second circle: "))

# your work goes here





# Extend your program to support any two circles regardless of their
#     location (as opposed to lying on the same horizontal line).
